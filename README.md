# PasswordManager-Test
The unsecure GTK password manager from hell. Employs a custom binary database and amateur frontend work.

This project also contains a legacy C implementation under the `c_impl/` folder.

# Dependencies
This program depends on GTK4, PyGObject and cryptography. These can be installed with:
```
sudo pacman -S gtk4 # use your favorite package manager here
pip install PyGObject cryptography
```
